- 👋 Hi, I’m Chitradeep, a Postdoc at the [Department of Meteorology, University of Reading, UK](https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/).
- 👀 My research interest involves understanding the long-term magnetic variability of our nearest star, the Sun.
- 🌱 Currently, I am reconstructing the Sun's magnetic activity cycles through past millennia using radio-isotope data.
- 🌱 I’m also passionate about playing with statistical data analysis and data visualisation techniques.
- 💞️ Open for collaborations.
- 📫 You can reach me at chitrodeephysics1729[at]gmail[dot]com
