- 👋 Hi, I’m Chitradeep.
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding long-term magnetic activity of our nearest star, the Sun.
- 🌱 I’m currently simulating a 3D Sun in a computer and trying hard to benchmark it with observations.
- 🌱 I’m also learning various statistical data analysis techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in heliophysics.
- 📫 You can reach me at chitrodeephysics1729[at]gmail[dot]com
