- 👋 Hi, I’m Chitradeep, a PhD student from the [Center of Excellence in Space Sciences India (CESSI)](cessi.in).
- 👀 My research interest involves understanding the long-term magnetic activity of our nearest star, the Sun.
- 🌱 Currently I am developing 3D MHD simulations of the Sun and trying hard to benchmark it with observations.
- 🌱 I’m also passionate about playing with statistical data analysis and data visualization techniques.
- 💞️ Looking forward to collaborating on the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in heliophysics.
- 📫 You can reach me at chitrodeephysics1729[at]gmail[dot]com
